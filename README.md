To run the boilerplate API server:

    git clone git@git.joyent.com:workflow.git
    cd workflow
    git submodule update --init
    make all
    node server.js

To update the documentation, edit "docs/index.restdown" and run `make docs`
to update "docs/index.html".

Before commiting/pushing run `make prepush` and, if possible, get a code
review.
